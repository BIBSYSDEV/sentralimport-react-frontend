        "title": "Semantic Segmentation with Light Field Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks",
        "summary": "Semantic segmentation is of great importance and a challenge in computer vision. One of its main problems is how to efficiently obtain rich information (geometric structure) and identify useful features from higher dimensions. A light field camera, due to its special microlens array structure, can completely record the angular-spatial information of scenes, which is attractive and has great potential to improve the performance of semantic segmentation tasks. Inspired by this, we propose an end-to-end semantic segmentation network that can process light field macropixel images robustly and extract their features. In addition, this network can flexibly and efficiently load the different popular deep learning backbones. Furthermore, we propose an efficient angular model, which, to learn the angular features between the different viewpoints of the macropixel image, improves the nonlinearity of angular-spatial features and enhances multichannel semantic correlations. To evaluate the network, we construct a new real scene light field dataset comprising 800 high-quality samples. The quantitative and qualitative results show that the highest mean intersection over union (mIoU) based on our algorithm is greater than 57%. Our algorithm achieves a 10.30% increase compared with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms. In combination with different backbones or multiscale light field macropixel images, the network can also achieve comparable results. This preliminary work demonstrates that the combination of light field imaging and deep learning technology has potential applications in the future study of semantic segmentation.",

        "summary": "The Big Five theory suggests that five components in teamwork are essential for team effectiveness in stressful environments. Furthermore, three coordinating mechanisms are claimed to be decisive to upholding and informing vital teamwork processes. Although much research has been conducted into the Big Five theory and its components, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been made of the relative importance of the three mechanisms and their impact on team effectiveness. Also, only a few studies have tried to investigate whether the components and the coordinating mechanisms are trainable. This study aims to make a theoretical contribution to the part of the theory focusing on the coordinating mechanisms. Secondly, it investigates whether training can improve team performance. Working in teams of two, 166 police officers participated in a simulated operational scenario. Correlational analyses indicated that all Big Five teamwork behaviors and coordinating mechanisms relate to external ratings of team performance. Only the mechanisms of Closed Loop Communication (CLC) and Shared Mental Model (SMM) predicted performance indicators, with SMM predicting above and beyond the effect of CLC. No effect of the training program was found. The study provides new evidence in a police situation that the most important coordinating mechanism of the Big Five theory is that of shared mental models, which in turn has consequences for the type of training needed.",

Two alternative scenarios are investigated, the first considers to tieback Alta-Gohta to a field that is 60 km away, Johan Castberg, and the second to tieback the field to Goliat, another field at 100 km further. A sensitivity analysis in terms of CAPEX and OPEX is performed to assess the trade-off between selecting the host to be Johan Castberg or Goliat. The results indicate that the profitability and host selection for a tieback development plan of Alta-Gohta is highly dependent on the start time and the costs of the project.",

        "summary": "This paper presents three dimensional (3D) numerical modeling of local scour around a single pile under the combined action of waves and currents. A semi-coupled hydrodynamic and morphological model (REEF3D) is used in this study which solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equation with k-ω turbulence model closure. The Exner equation is used to calculate the changes in bed elevation. The use of the Level-Set method is done to capture the changes in the free surface. Realistic scour and deposition calculations are aided with the use of modified critical bed shear stress reduction formulation on a sloping bed supplemented with the use of Sand Slide algorithm in the morphological model. The scouring process is modeled in this study using a reduced-length numerical wave tank with wave generation and wave absorption implemented using active wave absorption method. The model is validated for the numerical modeling of local scour around a single pile in steady current, waves alone, and combined wave–current environment. The validated model is used to analyze the effect of Keulegan–Carpenter (KC) number and combined wave–current parameter (U\u003cinf\u003ecw\u003c/inf\u003e) on normalized equilibrium scour depth. It is found that the normalized equilibrium scour depth for scour under waves alone, waves combined with weak currents, and waves combined with mild current do not significantly differ for flow developed in a low KC number environment. However for waves combined with strong currents the normalized equilibrium scour depth increases significantly. For large KC numbers, the normalized equilibrium scour depth is found to have increased with an increase in KC number as well as combined wave–current parameter (U\u003cinf\u003ecw\u003c/inf\u003e).",
